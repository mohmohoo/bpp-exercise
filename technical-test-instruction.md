# Instructions

1. Read through the **User Stories** carefully.  

2. You'll have about an hour to interpret the Stories into code, and **10 minutes** for a quick code review.

3. We've provided a basic project structure to get you going.  2 Unit Test projects, XUnit and MSTest, pick whichever you are comfortable to work with.

What we're looking for
----------------------------

- How you can apply your **Object Oriented language skills** to transform the User Stories into a working solution.  

- A good use of TDD (if you can)

- A clear separation of concerns, using OO Design / Programming techniques

- The code should reflect the intent of the User Stories as much as possible, so please do try and stick to the brief, but most importantly, stick to what you know best.

- <u>There shouldn't be a need for a Database</u>, and we don't want to see how you use your skills here, so please try and work using simple storage / mocks / stubs / test data to save you time.
- Don't worry too much about completion, as there'll be time to explain your solution during the code review, but do try and code as quickly as possible. It will be hard to do a code review when there's nothing to show..


Bonus
-----------

- Clean Code (maintainable and readable)
- OO Design Principles
- SOLID Principles
- Unit Tested / TDD
- Shows good encapsulation
- Any Design Patterns you feel are appropriate
